						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;[Trump] added, &#8216;We're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous, and it has to end.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
							<p>&#8220;But birthright citizenship is the law of at least 30 countries, including many U.S. neighbors in North and South America.&#8221;</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;The Trump campaign ad is the latest example of the President's willingness to lie and fear-monger in order to tear at racial and societal divides; to embrace demagoguery to bolster his own political power and the cause of the Republican midterm campaign.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I find it so fascinating and amusing that every week, there's been at least one article about something Trump said or did. And they have all been ridiculous.</p></li>
