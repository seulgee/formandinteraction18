						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Other elements to consider would be Singapore’s humidity and tropical climate, as well as where the air taxis can land.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>The article also mentions that volocoptors have been operating regularly in Germany since 2016, which I didn't know about. It'd be interesting to see how the different climate in Singapore can affect its operation.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;But the thing that I am most proud of is that Bob Mankoff said of one of my cartoons that it was the worst he had seen in his entire life. Hell, that’s something to brag about. I said, &#8216;Don’t worry, I can do worse,&#8217; and he burst out laughing.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Very admirable that Juan Astasio Soriano (the author of this article) is able to digest criticism and rejection in a such a positive way. The more rejections you get, the more practice you get. Something I should work on.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Data is created, generated, collected, captured, and extended by humans. Even &#8216;raw&#8217; data is never truly untainted. The fact that any data set exists means that a human has already decided what signal to capture and how to go about capturing it. That’s why data is always incomplete and messy, and needs to be interpreted and analyzed. It can be biased through what is included or excluded, how it is framed, and how it is presented.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>My marketing research professor was telling us to not lie about the data because data is the truth. Interesting to see that this article says that data is NOT the truth.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;The devices often ask customers to make tipping decisions on the fly—with the person who just served them looking on, along with everyone else waiting in line.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I actually never saw the Square system this way. I guess it's really more about how much you care about how other people in the same retail space think about you. Because there is really no reason for you to tip unless the store staff or the cashier gave you exceptional customer service, or did something nice that is not a part of that person's &#8220;standard&#8221; everyday task at work.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Federal prosecutors allege that the hand belonged to 49-year-old Bruce Michael Alexander from Tampa, another passenger on the Southwest Airlines flight, who reportedly told authorities after being arrested Sunday that &#8216;the President of the United States says it’s ok to grab women by their private parts,&#8217; according to a criminal complaint.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This is so fucked up. The extent to how much this country is moving backwards ever since the start of his presidency amazes me. It also scares me to see what else some people would do because they think the president would agree with their actions.</p></li>

							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Gotham started as a print font for GQ but was later made available for web use. But it is not free. Moreover, it’s not a font you can buy. Instead you can rent the font for web use with limitations on page views. While this is fine for businesses with budgets and marketing departments, your freelance web designer and developer are going to look for a free solution. // Montserrat was that solution.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Always pretty cool to read about the history of a typeface and its uses. I learned more about grotesque typefaces.</p></li>

With the July 2017 FDA approval of Embrace™, the company enters an exciting phase of commercial possibilities.&#8221;</p>

									<li class="bullet"><p>I feel like we generally don't see much about &#8220;baby centered&#8221; design as more of a bigger technological achievement out there, unless we're looking for it. It was refreshiing to read about a technical/medical design catered for newborns.</p></li>

I felt very moved and shocked when I was reading their stories with their photos, so I was reading into the history of this horrifying 100-day period.</p></li>
