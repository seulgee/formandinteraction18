						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Those who voted for Breed's removal said she wielded too much of an advantage, as both the Board of Supervisors president and acting mayor, while running for the permanent mayoral job.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>London Breed being elected as the first black female mayor of San Francisco is such a huge milestone in the history of US politics. The pulled quote above shows how the majority of the Board of Supervisors voted to remove her from her temporary position as acting mayor of SF after the passing of the former mayor. The excuse they gave in the quote is ridiculous; looking at her situation objectively, most people would say that she is the perfectly qualified candidate for the job.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Poise, in the common imagination, is a female quality, the demonstration of steel and grace under pressure. That women should feel pressure is taken for granted; that they should respond with steel is not. To be angry, to be sad, to be forceful, to be fearful, even to be detached: all are liabilities.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>How is it that a woman's credibility is dependent on how she performs under pressure, even at times when she is speaking of a sensitive and traumatic experience, such as Dr. Ford's own?</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Senator Orrin Hatch, who once claimed that Hill had lifted parts of her harassment allegations against Thomas from &#8216;The Exorcist,&#8217; called Ford &#8216;pleasing,&#8217; an &#8216;attractive&#8217; witness.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Why is it that those men are responding <em>only</em> to Dr. Ford's physical and ambient qualities when she is speaking of a serious issue that needs to be addressed in Kavanaugh's appointment as a Supreme Court judge?</p></li>

							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Instead, he went on to state baldly and repeatedly that, in cases of alleged sexual assault involving prominent men, he is inclined to sympathize with the accused rather than the accuser.&#8221;</p>
