							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Here are four elements that I believe are the foundation of great digital products: Research, Empathy, Simplicity and Speed.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I agree with the author in that those are very crucial components of good digital products. But it seems really obvious.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;&#8216;I would love to see a world where my students can learn about anything from anyone they interact with during their day,&#8217; she told GOOD. &#8216;Whether that means learning about the solar system, the candy options at a store, or even farts, it would be so great for them to have that language access anywhere they go.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This was a very interesting article to read because it was an eye opener in some way since as a hearing person, I wasn't very aware of this issue. Anna Trupiano (the teacher in the article) brings up a very real, important point that the world should be more accessible in terms of language for the deaf community.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Throughout his lifetime, Hopper followed Henri's advice: to paint the city life he knew best.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This sale has now become the most expensive of Hopper's art acquired at auction. On the quote above, I think it's a helpful advice in that it encourages the artist to dig deeper into whatever scene he/she paints.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;This lady at my old job asked me where I was born and then asked if I speak the same language as my supervisor who is Polynesian. I said no and Thailand is in Southeast Asia. She responded by saying, &#8216;you guys look alike.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This is a quote from Khoun (30), who is Thai/Laos/Cambodian. As an Asian woman in the US, I've also experienced numerous incidents of racially charged comments towards me. This quote is quite shocking in that people still think it's completely OK to openly talk about how Asians look alike, TO AN ASIAN.</p></li>
