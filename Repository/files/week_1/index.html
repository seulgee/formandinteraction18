						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;In the field of medicine, schools have become worried that students saddled with steep debt are increasingly pursuing top-paying specialties rather than careers in family medicine, pediatrics and research.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This article led me to think about how actions are mostly primarily driven by economic aspects, even in choosing a medical profession. It is inspiring to see that NYU has taken a big step in removing the huge barrier in people pursuing their passions by making their medical school's tuition free.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>Augmented reality has been a big interest of mine for the past few months. So far, I've only seen one AR exhibition in person last summer at the Venice Biennale, and one being covered in press a few years back at the MOMA in NYC. It's exciting to see the realm of AR as a form of interactive art expand.</p></li>
