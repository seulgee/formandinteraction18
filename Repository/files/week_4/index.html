						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;The new policy, which is being implemented starting with the Class of 2023, is meant to help even the playing field for students coming from low-income and underrepresented communities, university officials said.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I actually had a discussion on this topic with my boyfriend a couple of weeks or so, when the article came out on how some Asian students were suing Harvard for discrimination in the application process. I think UChicago is setting a good example in how higher education institutions should work on diversifying the socioeconomic statuses of each of their represented student bodies. At institutions like WashU, we really need to see a broad range of socioeconomic classes because the majority of students here come from wealthier families, but when they come here for education, they are not really seeing that there's much more outside of the wealthier societies.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;&#8216;A school is a place to learn and grow educationally, emotionally and morally. A disruption of the school will not be tolerated,&#8217; Curtis Rhodes, superintendent for Needville Independent School District in Texas, said about his decision to suspend students for at least three days who participate in protests.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This was an article from a few months ago, but I just came across it this past week for some reason. It talks about how some more elite colleges stated that they would not penalize students for participating in protests (especially after the gun safety law protests). However, the pulled quote from above is such nonsense to me because how are you going to educate students if you're going to have them cut off from being active in their expressions?</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;while the three players have been reprimanded and apologized for the racist costumes, the Penguin Football Club also offered a (predictable) defense of the players, saying the trioâ€™s &#8216;actions were never intended to be racist in any way&#8217; and &#8216;all they meant to do was dress as one of their sporting idols.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Why do people keep on thinking that it is OK to &#8220;impersonate&#8221; people of other races (non-caucasian) by painting over their skins? Will this issue ever be resolved?</p></li>

									<li class="bullet"><p>It really baffles me to see that some ignorant and careless people would actually think that this kind of &#8220;prank&#8221; is funny. There are too many psychopaths in this world...</p></li>
