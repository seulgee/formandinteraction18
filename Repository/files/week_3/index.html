						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;I think we have to get used to it. We're not that good. Even today, we still have a lot of people rejecting us...I applied for jobs, 30 times: rejected...When KFC came to China, came to my city, 24 people went for the job. 23 people accepted. I was the only guy who didn't...I applied for Harvard 10 times: rejected.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This article includes the video of the interview with Jack Ma, and his experiences and views on rejection. It was inspiring to hear him talk about how he had been rejected countless times by the smallest job opportunities, but refused to give up and built Alibaba to where it is today. I used to always view rejection as a negative; honestly I still do to a certain extent. But I should get used to it, and use it as a stepping stone for me to further improve and challenge myself.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;I started thinking about logo generators, flyer templates, stock imagery, and even online platforms which encourage cheap and fast design services. They all share that same pre-determined quality where the design is, to a certain extent, decided beforehand. I started asking questions like: &#8216;where does the graphic designer sit in this equation?&#8217; and &#8216;Is the graphic designer still even necessary when templates come into play?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>One of her works incorporates printed out stock images on paper with heavier weight than common printing paper, with the &#8220;stock image&#8221; indicator embossed onto it. I think the question she's approaching is very interesting, in terms of how much do people really care about &#8220;design literacy,&#8221; and what are designers getting out of this environment where &#8220;design for cheap&#8221; is so abundant?</p></li>

							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;&#8216;I really wouldn’t want just happiness, and I don’t want just sadness either,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I don’t want to be depressed. I want to be able to have good days and bad days.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This is was a quote from an interview with <em>New York</em>'s Craig Jenkins. I never thought of wanting to have a balance of good and bad days. But I guess having that balance is what shapes me as a person. I wasn't the biggest fan of him, but I enjoyed listening to his music.</p></li>

							<li class="bullet"><p>This is a subject I've always been aware of, and interested in. I've been doing some more research on this for Audra's class, and I learned that the differences between the two variations of the Korean language wasn't just present in vocabulary, but also in grammar.</p></li>
