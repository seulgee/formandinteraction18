						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Her job became to build a business by introducing the social sector and the global development field to human-centered design.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>It's interesting to note how the term &#8220;Human-centered design&#8221; reads as making the user experience better and improving one's everyday life, but it was yet perceived as something for the affluent.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;On Aug. 12 and 13, 1904, the organizers of the Olympic Games partnered with the World’s Fair to host Anthropology Days, a &#8216;special Olympics,&#8217; in which &#8216;natives&#8217; would compete alongside their &#8216;civilized&#8217; American and European counterparts. Chief Organizers William J. McGee and James Sullivan drew the participants from the World’s Fair ethnic displays, which featured &#8216;savages&#8217; imported from countries around the world.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I learned about the Anthropology Days at the 1904 World's Fair in Dr. Alexis Clark's art history class last semester, and ,as it always is, it was baffling and shocking to see the predominance of racism in every aspect of life back in history. I thought that this was an interesting Op-Ed piece because I wasn't aware of how the &#8220;Special Olympics&#8221; took place as well. This is a piece of St.Louis history worth knowing, and I hope it makes the WashU community think about it as well.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;The pictures feature survivors holding up posters with quotes from their attackers, and many of those who volunteered to be a part of the project were men who had been subjected to sexual assault, child abuse, and domestic violence.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I had never come across this project before, but this series of photographs was extremely sensitive and moving. When people speak of sexual assault, we usually automatically default the victims as females; that's why I think projects like this are very powerful in making people think deeper.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Wrightwood 659 is a major transformation of a historic building from the 1920s and will be dedicated to exhibitions on architecture and on socially engaged art.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Exciting to see another art venue designed by Tadao Ando. There's a whole site in Korea called &#8220;Museum San,&#8221; and it was an amazing, immersive experience when I went to visit.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;This week, Google announced plans to release Lens within Google Images in fall 2018, giving users a chance to identify specific elements within an image to search for additional relevant images or product pages.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Just having a visual element itself is a tremendous help to a lot of users of anything. It's really exciting to hear that Google is implementing Lens in Google Images this fall. I wonder how much further technology can push visual search.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;The announcement from the SEC comes two days after the agency filed a lawsuit against Musk, claiming he misled investors. The suit centers on tweets Musk sent on August 7 in which he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, causing the company's stock to soar. He had not secured the funding, the SEC said.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I'm interested to see what his motivation was for making this false tweet, and how Tesla would be different (if at all) with Elon Musk stepping down to just being CEO from being both CEO and chairman. </p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;&#8216;State Dept. will no longer let same-sex domestic partners of UN employees get visas unless they are married,&#8217; she tweeted, noting that &#8216;only 12% of UN member states allow same-sex marriage.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
