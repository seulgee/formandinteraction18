						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;He was one of hundreds of people who died in 2017 due to overwork, according to government data. Among OECD countries, South Koreans work more hours per week on average than all but one other country, and almost 50% more than famously industrious Germany.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I feel like this is an issue that is not talked about enough in South Korea. I've always heard "real world adults" telling me or talking about how working in Korea is horrible. Over the summer, I was only working as an intern for a month in Korea, but no one ever left at 6pm (my hours were 9am to 6pm). I wonder what else the Korean government is doing or planning on doing to improve the work conditions for the employees.</p></li>

							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;&#8216;On the day of the mass murder of 11 human beings at the hands of a deranged &#8216;nationalist,&#8217; you played his song &#8216;Happy&#8217; to a crowd at a political event in Indiana,&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>The news of the shooting was really shocking and tragic. Ever since Trump became president, it seems like there has been an increasing amount of hate-driven shootings. Playing Pharrell's song was really insensitive of him.</p></li>
