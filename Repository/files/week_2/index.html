					<li><em>Microinteractions</em> by Dan Saffer &#8212; Ch.1</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Apple famously changed directions (from down to up) in OS X Lion after the introduction of its iPhones in order to align its laptops and mobile devices to &#8216;natural scrolling.&#8217;&#8221; (p.11)</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>Before starting to read this book, I never really thought of what microinteractions were. I remember being a bit thrown off when I first switched to a MacBook in 2012 from a PC because of the trackpad scrolling. Ever since then I've gotten used to it, and it became my way of &#8216;natural scrolling&#8217; to me.</p></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Very few of us really know what's happening when we use any kind of software or device.&#8221; (p.17)</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>The layers and depths of microinteractions are ENDLESS! I think this connects to what we discussed in class this week &#8212; a good microinteraction is one that happens so smoothly and naturally that the user doesn't even notice it.</p></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="bullet"><p>Reading this chapter made me realize what microinteractions are. In this chapter, Saffer mentions the change in directions of the paragraph icon buttons in Word when the direction of the text changes in the document. I think this was the point where I realized that how detailed microinteractions could be.</p></li>

					<li><a href="https://medium.theuxblog.com/the-5e-experience-design-model-7852324d46c" target="_blank">The 5E Experience Design Model</a></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>Rather than pulling a quote from this article, I want to talk about the &#8220;Feeling&#8221; part of the Journey Map.</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>The Journey Map reinforces the designers to think about what the essence of what our participants to feel is at each stage of the 5E Experience Design Model. I think this is a very important part of experience design because we cannot lose the core starting point of our high concept.</p></li>

					<li><a href="https://nextshark.com/hong-kong-nuggets-90-donate-charity/">Hong Kong Man Livestreams Attempt to Eat 90 McNuggets in Under 90 Minutes for Charity</a></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Joe only managed to consume 54 nuggets and was fined 3,600 Hong Kong dollars ($459) as a penalty, which is still quite impressive as he did the challenge without throwing up.<br>What’s even more remarkable is that he plans to donate the penalty money to the Ronald McDonald house charity.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I honestly don't remember how I came across this article. But I thought it was interesting to see the ways in which people gamble with their chances for rewards. Good for him for donating his penalty money to charity, though.</p></li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/world/asia/india-gay-sex-377.html">India Gay Sex Ban Is Struck Down. &#8216;Indefensible,&#8217; Court Says.</a></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;In their ruling, the justices said homosexuality was &#8216;natural.&#8217;&#8221;<br>&#8220;But what made India stand out from most — at least until Thursday — was its application of an anachronistic law drawn up by British colonizers during the Victorian era and kept on the books for 150 years.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This is a huge step India took, not only for the country, but for the world. Although same-sex marriage isn't legal in India yet, it just acknowledged that homosexuality is not something to be frowned upon, or punished for. It's shocking to see how strong the British influence was on it, seeing that the article mentions how Hinduism, India's dominant religion, actually condones homosexuality &#8212; yet the country had been ruling it as a criminal activity. This article prompted me to reflect, once again, on how behind Korea is.</p></li>

					<li>Podcast &#8212; "In Praise of Incrementalism" by Freakonomics Radio</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>In this podcast, they talked about how lowering one's expectations leads to a higher chance of succeeding. I thought this was a very interesting approace because previously, I've always associated lowering expectations with less <em>disappointment</em> rather than more <em>success.</em></p></li>
