							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;&#8216;We call it climate prospecting,&#8217; says Caleb Harper, age 36, the founder and director of OpenAg. &#8216;[Ferrero] isn’t trying to replace groves with trees in giant boxes. Rather, they want to know how to optimize growth of a hard-to-grow thing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>AI has been an emerging interest of mine lately. This article was fascinating and thought provoking to read because Harper is saying that OpenAg is using AI to &#8220;optimize growth,&#8221; and while it does that, the crops it grows does not face any hardships they would face in a natural environment. I wonder how this would affect the evolution of these crops in the long run.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;The BiAffect study is part of a larger trend in psychology of attempting to measure how the brain functions using “digital exhaust” from users’ daily interactions with technology.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This seems like a pretty novel approach to monitoring someone's health, and efficient in a way that it takes a mobile device, something a lot of people interact with every day, to do so. I'd like to see the process of how apps like this gathers information from the user's interactions with the device, then interprets it in psychological terms.</p></li>

					<li>Oct 13, 2018: <em>Basquiat Before Basquiat: East 12th Street, 1979–1980</em> at CAM</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>I've never really studied Basquiat, or looked into his life. This exhibition portrayed his life with his roommate Alexis Adler in a small apartment in East Village of Manhattan. There were a lot of photographs taken by Adler, of Basquiat at work at their home. I loved reading his notes in his sketchbooks, found objects, objects from their home, etc.</p></li>
						</ul>
					<li>Oct 15 &#8211; 16, 2018: Austin Road Show</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>Lots of studio visits within a couple of days. All of them seemed to really value PROCESS and COLLABORATION. The road show was a great visit for me, in that I got to find out more about the subdivisions within Interaction Design.</p></li>
						</ul>
					<li>Oct 17, 2018: A tragic homicide in Seoul, Korea</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>A man in his 30s brutally stabbed a 20-yr-old internet cafe staff all over his face. For no good reason. I read the details in numerous claims and articles and they are just too gruesome for me to keep on thinking about. When the victim first sensed aggression and heard death threats from the attacker, he called the police &#8212; but the police took no further action when they got to the internet cafe, and told them to &#8220;talk it out.&#8221; They left the attacker with the victim together. The media was highlighing the fact that the attacker was suffering from depression for more than 10 years, and people are mad that he's going to get away just because of that. This issue got me thinking more about the flawedness of criminal legislature in Korea, since there are upsettingly large amount of cases where the attacker of any sort gets sentenced a light punishment.</p></li>
						</ul>
					<li>Gender inequality in Korea</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>My subject for the next project in Audra's class is Feminism in Korea. In the process of doing some research on the subject matter, I came across some data that was shocking and upsetting to accept. OECD reported that according to the data from 2017 and later, Korea placed <em>last</em> out of 36 countries in the gender wage gap percentage point (34.6). Furthermore, in 2016's data, it was reported that men in Korea were earning almost as twice as much in salary as women.</p></li>
						</ul>
					<li>Client projects</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>Sometimes when working on client projects in a non-design institution, your printing company will fuck up production but your client and your boss will not feel as strongly about the mistake as you do because they don't know design. I've been working on this project for the past 6 months and now the final products do not completely reflect the intended design, but nobody's going to reproduce the final products and I will just look bad.</p></li>
