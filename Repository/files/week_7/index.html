							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Imagine something that looks like a MacBook and works like a MacBook, but has the guts of an iPhone. In addition to things like facial recognition and AR capabilities, it could have longer battery life, built-in always-on connectivity to fast 5G networks, and more.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I couldn't access the original article because I don't have a subscription to the WSJ. But this other article had a rundown of it. I wonder what it means to have a laptop that also functions like an iPhone, but also Apple must have thought about this before, but what is the reason they aren't implementing it?</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Why are the two fighters, who showed aggression outside the match in the octagon – who fought, insulted each other and more – receiving so much praise, when a woman like Serena Williams ended up being fined $17,000 USD after questioning the referee’s calls at the US Open? How come when a woman stands up for herself and her own beliefs, she’s all of a sudden &#8216;too emotional&#8217; and &#8216;not a good sportsman?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>I can't believe that Serena Williams got fined $17,000 just because she questioned the referee's calls. And in contrast McGregor and Nurmagomedov are being defended and admired by so many people around the world because the reason they fought was so that they could defend their own voices. The author of this article mentions Billie Jean King; I watched a movie on her professional life, starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell, over the summer, and just from one small portion of the sports world it was so hard for women to get a place to play sports professionally because men did not approve of the fact that we were capable of playing sports equally as well. It's baffling so see that the reason why we couldn't join the professional leagues in the first place was because we were seen as less capable &#8212; yet we are held to a higher standard in sports in men.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away • drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances • take trains and buses instead of planes • use videoconferencing instead of business travel • use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer • insulate homes • demand low carbon in every consumer product&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>The environment, especially when it comes to global warming, has always been something I care about a lot. It is scary to see how urgently action is required now, and especially since a lot of it depends on how seriously politicians with power around the world take this issue. Knowing that Trump, a very powerful politician who most definitely should NOT have all the power he has, believes that global warming is fake news made up by China, I fear for the world that a lot of politicians will not give a shit about the environment.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;Banksy has released a video showing how he secretly built a shredder into one of his paintings that self-destructed after it was sold for more than £1m.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>In the video, it was really funny how the Sotheby associates panicked and tried to pull down the painting as it started to shred itself. Anyways, Banksy is a genius for coming up with this idea. He's creating art around the world, where the public can access it &#8212; yet the big auction sites take ownership and auction them off to wealthy people. What does it mean to have the painting destroyed now? I'm really curious about how he triggered the shredder as soon as the painting was sold.</p></li>

						<ul>
							<li class="bullet"><p>&#8220;So Snapchat's development team apparently decided it didn't want to waste time supporting different Android versions, and instead, took the viewfinder-screenshot approach to make things easier on themselves. This way, one image capture method would work on all Android devices, even though it results in inferior quality.&#8221;</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="bullet"><p>This is so funny how the Snapchat's developers didn't even care to try to build the app Android-compatible. Where is the line for developers to start not caring about other media devices?</p></li>
